 
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She says she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
[Just as well Just as well Just as well]
Nice dream, nice dream
Nice dream, nice dream
