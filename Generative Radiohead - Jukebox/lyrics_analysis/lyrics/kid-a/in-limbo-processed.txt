 
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Being the first in the Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
This beautiful world
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
