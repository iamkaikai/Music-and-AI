 
I can't afford to breathe in this town,
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand.
Hooked back up to the cathode ray,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
I want to breathe, I want to grow,
I'd say I want it but I don't know how.
I work, I bleed, I beg, I pray,
but I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off dead,
I'm better off.
Prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself,
prove yourself.
Woh
