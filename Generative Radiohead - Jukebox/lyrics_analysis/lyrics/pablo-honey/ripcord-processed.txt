 
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys.
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed.
You're free until you drop,
you're free until you've had enough
and you don't understand.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no ripcord.
Aeroplane do I mean what I mean?
Oh it's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane.
A thousand miles an hour
on politics and power
that she don't understand.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no ripcord.
The answer to your prayers,
we'll drop you anywhere.
No ripcord, no ripcord,
no ripcord, no no no no ripcord,
oh yeah.
