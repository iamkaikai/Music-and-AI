 
I feel better, I feel better now you've gone.
I got better, I got better, I got strong.
I feel better, I feel better now there's nothing wrong.
I got better, I got better, I got strong.
Tell me something, tell me something I don't know.
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing, and let it go.
I got something, I got something, heaven knows.
I got something, I got something, I don't know.
