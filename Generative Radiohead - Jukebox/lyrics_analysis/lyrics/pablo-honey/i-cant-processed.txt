 
Please forget the words that I just blurted out,
it wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt,
it keeps rattling my cage.
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down,
and even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Soon your things that keep, that keep me underground,
so many words that I, that I can never find.
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
If you give up on me now,
I'll be gutted like I've never been before.
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't,
even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't.
