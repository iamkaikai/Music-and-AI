 
And the wise men say 'I don't want to hear your voice.'
And the thin men say 'I don't want to hear your voice.'
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be.
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
And my mother say 'We spit on your son some more.'
And the buildings say 'We spit on your face some more.'
And the feeling is that there's something wrong,
'cause I can't find the words, and I can't find the songs.
Stop whispering, start shouting,
stop whispering, start shouting.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint.
Dear Sir, I have a complaint,
can't remember what it is,
doesn't matter anyway.
Doesn't matter anyway.
