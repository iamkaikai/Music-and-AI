 
I never wanted anything but this,
I worked hard, tried hard.
I ran around in domestic bliss,
I fought hard, died hard.
Everytime you're running out of here,
everytime you're running I get the fear.
I never wanted any broken bones,
scarred face, no home.
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate,
and I burn all hate.
Everytime you're running out on me
everytime you're running I can see.
I'm not a veg'table,
I will not control myself.
I spit on the hand that feeds me,
I will not control myself.
The waters break, the waters run all over me.
The waters break, the waters run
and this time you're gonna pay.
I'm not a veg'table,
I will not control myself.
I spit on the hand that feeds me,
I will not control myself.
