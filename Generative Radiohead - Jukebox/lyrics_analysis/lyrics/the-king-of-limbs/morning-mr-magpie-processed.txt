 
You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all my magic
Took my memories
Ooohhhh
No no no no no no
You know you should, but you don’t
You know you should, but you don’t
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
Took my melody
