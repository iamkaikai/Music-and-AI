 
It’s like I’m falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that’s been carrying me
It’s like I’m falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture
I’m a heart in cold ground
Like I’m falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Finally I’m free of all the weight I’ve been carrying
And as a woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I’m a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that’s been carrying me
I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just a number
I wanna slip it over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
Wake me up, wake me up
If you think this is over
Then you’re wrong
Wake me up, wake me up
Like I’m falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
When I ask you again
When I ask you again
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
