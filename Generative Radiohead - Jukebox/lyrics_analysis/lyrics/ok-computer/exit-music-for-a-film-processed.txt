 
Wake from your sleep,
the drying of your tears,
Today we escape, we escape.
Pack and get dressed
before your father hears us,
before all hell breaks loose.
Breathe, keep breathing,
don't lose your nerve.
Breathe, keep breathing,
I can't do this alone.
Sing us a song,
a song to keep us warm,
there's such a chill, such a chill.
And you can laugh a spineless laugh,
we hope your rules and wisdom choke you.
And now we are one
in everlasting peace,
we hope that you choke, that you choke,
we hope that you choke, that you choke,
we hope that you choke, that you choke.
