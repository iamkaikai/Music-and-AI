 
A heart that's full up like a landfill,
a job that slowly kills you,
bruises that won't heal.
You look so tired-unhappy,
bring down the government,
they don't, they don't speak for us.
I'll take a quiet life,
a handshake of carbon monoxide,
with no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
Silent silence.
This is my final fit,
my final bellyache,
with no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises please.
Such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden.
No alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises,
no alarms and no surprises please.
EARLY VERSION:
he was sick of his clock stopping
wind it up, that girls stayed sleeping next to him
watch stops, the batteries run down
he started his broken sentence, 'no alarms...'
the watch stops, the batteries run down,
he started his broken sentence,'no alarms and no surprises...'
he was sick of her excuses
to not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom
he was sick of his clock stopping, wind it up
no alarms an no surprises...
no alarms an no surprises...
no alarms an no surprises, please
