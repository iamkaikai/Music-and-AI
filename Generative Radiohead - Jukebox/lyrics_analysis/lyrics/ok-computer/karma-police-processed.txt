 
Karma police
arrest this man,
he talks in maths,
he buzzes like a fridge,
he's like a detuned radio.
Karma police
arrest this girl,
her Hitler hairdo
is making me feel ill
and we have crashed her party.
This is what you get,
this is what you get,
this is what you get,
when you mess with us.
Karma police
I've given all I can,
it's not enough,
I've given all I can
but we're still on the payroll.
This is what you get,
this is what you get,
this is what you get,
when you mess with us.
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself.
Phew, for a minute there,
I lost myself, I lost myself.
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself.
Phew, for a minute there,
I lost myself, I lost myself.
