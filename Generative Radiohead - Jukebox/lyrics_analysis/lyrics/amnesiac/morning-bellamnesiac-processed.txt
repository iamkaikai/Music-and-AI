 
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me
Where'd you park the car
Where'd you park the car
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
