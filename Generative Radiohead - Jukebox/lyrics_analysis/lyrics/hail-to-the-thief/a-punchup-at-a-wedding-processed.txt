 
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there and it wasn't like that
You came here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn round stay frozen to the spot.
You had to piss on our parade
Uou had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding.
The pointless snide remarks
OfÂ hammer-headedÂ sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punchup at a wedding.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
