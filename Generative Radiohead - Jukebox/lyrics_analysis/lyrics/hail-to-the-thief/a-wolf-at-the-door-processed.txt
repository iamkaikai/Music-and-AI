 
Drag him out the window
Dragging out your dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Step up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me call the doctor
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see him again
If I squeal to the cops
Walking like a giant crane and
With my x ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses.
Cold wives and sunday papers.
City boys in 1st class
Don't know we're born
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Oh I wish you'd get up
Go over get up go over and turn this tape off.
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see him again
If I squeal to the cops
