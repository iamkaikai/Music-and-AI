 
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell sit down, stand up
Walk into the jaws of hell sit down, stand up
Anytime sit down
Anytime stand up
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out anytime sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out sit down, stand up
Anytime
Anytime
Stand up, sit down
The rain drops repeated
