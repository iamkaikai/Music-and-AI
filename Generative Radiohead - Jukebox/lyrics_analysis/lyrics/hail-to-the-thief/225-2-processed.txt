 
Are you such a dreamer?
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always
makes up five
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always
makes up five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you
can shout
It is too late now
Because
You have not been
paying attention
I try to sing along
I get it all wrong
Ezeepeezeeeezeepeeezee
NOT
I swat em like flies but
Like flies the burgers
Keep coming back
NOT
Maybe not
'All hail to the thief'
'But I am not!'
'Don't question my authority
or put me in the dock'
Cozimnot!
Go and tell the king that
The sky is falling in
When it's not
Maybe not.
ahh diddums.
