 
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me then you'll get relief
relief, relief, relief, ...
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me then you'll get relief
relief, relief, relief, relief...
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
