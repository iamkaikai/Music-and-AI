 
I'm stuck in the tardis
trapped in hyperspace
one minute snake charming
the next in a motorcade
all the right moves and
earn the right percent
watch me dance like a puppet
you can almost see the strings
give me an answer
give me a sign
i've been climbing up this ladder
i've been wasting my time
so long, so long
so long, so long
up on the ladder
no time to escape
up on the ladder
away for fucking sake
up on the ladder
try to call out your name
up on the ladder
you're all the fucking same
oh, you let the people down
you let the people down
you let the people down
