 
I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
Ooooohhhh
You killed the sound
removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
Ooooohhhh
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped around my face
All the lines wrapped around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
