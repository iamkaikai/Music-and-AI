 
Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all you
all human beings
Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
in rainbows
Because we separate like
ripples on a blank shore
in rainbows
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all you
all human beings
