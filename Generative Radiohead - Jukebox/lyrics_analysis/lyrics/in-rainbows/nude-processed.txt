 
Don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
and feel up with noise
but there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
they're not going to happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
